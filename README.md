Anagrams Documentation - Ibotta Dev Project
=========

This is a Java web API built using the Spring Framework that allows fast searching and manipulation of an anagrams data store (dictionary).  


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


## Prerequisites/Caveats

The Anagrams project was created using IntelliJ 2017.1 Public Preview for Mac. Since this was a beta version of IntelliJ there were some bugs discovered in the IDE. Hopefully this should not affect users of other versions of IntelliJ.

All Java dependencies are managed via a maven pom file and should be downloaded automatically during the build.

The Anagrams Project has not been tested in Eclipse or other IDEs. 


## Installing

1. Download the Anagrams project from GitHub: [https://github.com/dhutcheon/Anagrams](https://github.com/dhutcheon/Anagrams)
2. Import the project into your IDE of choice
3. Open a terminal window and cd to the project directory root
4. To compile the project type:
```{bash}
$ mvn clean install
```
5. To run the project type:
```{bash}
$ mvn spring-boot:run
```
6. The Anagrams API will run on port 9000, to verify it is listening type:
```{bash}
$ curl -i http://localhost:9000/anagrams/read.json
```


## Running the tests

There are several methods for testing the API:

1. A suite of JUnit tests has been provided in src/main/test/java. No special test config should be necessary, right-click the test class in your IDE and click run. Integration tests are also included as part of the test suite, the integration tests will start up a local web server that hosts the API on a random port and will call each of the API methods in the Endpoint class.
2. Ruby tests (included in src/test/ruby) can be run when the API is started from the command line
3. curl, just remember to hit port 9000
4. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), the best API testing tool ever


## Optional Features
  
Both required and optional endpoints are identified in the comments section of each API method in the Endpoint class. The following optional features have been implemented:

- Endpoint that returns a count of words in the dictionary and min/max/median/average word length
- Endpoint that identifies words with the most anagrams
- Endpoint that takes a set of words and returns whether or not they are all anagrams of each other
- Endpoint to return all anagram groups of size >= *x*
- Endpoint to delete a word *and all of its anagrams*

_* Note:_ A single endpoint (stats.json) is used to implement both the "count of words" and "words with most anagrams" features. All data is returned in a Stats response object, JSON string returned is similar to the following:

```{json}
{
  "largestGroupsSize":10,
  "largestGroups":
  [
    ["elaps","lapse","lepas","pales","salep","saple","sepal","slape","spale","speal"],
    ["angor","argon","goran","grano","groan","nagor","orang","organ","rogan","ronga"]
  ],
  "min":1,
  "max":24,
  "median":9.0,
  "average":9.0,
  "wordCount":234370,
  "anagramCount":215842
}
```


## Additional Commentary/Retrospective

### Data Store
I used an in memory thread safe hash map to store the data (ConcurrentHashMap) where the key for the map is the anagram with each character sorted in alphabetical order. The value for each key in the map is the list of anagrams. Thread safety is an important consideration as multiple read and write operations could happen on the dictionary simultaneously through the API. Obviously, some form of data persistence rather than an in-memory data store would be an important consideration if this were a real-world application. Also, if the dictionary were to hold millions of words rather than a few thousand, "flattening" the data could be another consideration.  For example, the map could be split out into multiple maps based on the first letter of the key.     

### Spring Boot
I chose Spring Boot for this project as I believe this provides the best method for running the Anagrams API as a standalone application. I also believe this is an easier way to get the application up and running "out of the box" with the least amount of hassle for API developers and testers. 
The TestRestTemplate class is also part of the Spring Boot Framework and I have found it incredibly useful for creating integration tests and allowing for thorough testing and debugging of the API methods.  

### Error Handling
Proper exception checking and error handling would be an important feature to add to this API. Sending the client a descriptive error message in JSON format rather than a 500 http response code is helpful for those developing against the API and to allow client applications to gracefully handle errors. As of right now the API mainly handles "happy path" transactions, invalid data or a bad call to an endpoint method (poorly formatted JSON, wrong HTTP verb for example) will emit a 500 response without much detail as to the nature of the error.

### Yam Beans
I added support for YAML configuration files when starting the development on Anagrams as it is part of the template I use when creating new API projects. Given that there is only one real configuration field (dictionaryFile), it's safe to say this added some unnecessary complexity for such a small project.

### Edge Cases
A couple of the edge cases that I ran into had to do with case sensitivity and special characters: 
 - To hash the key for each anagram list in the dictionary I converted the key to lower case and made searching the anagrams dictionary case-insensitive. All words in the anagrams dictionary were also lower cased to ease searching. This made it impossible to identify proper-nouns based on capitalization and would make it harder to support the optional requirement for excluding proper nouns without some refactoring of the code.
 - I limited the use of special (non-alpha) characters to hyphens only as that is the only punctuation mark that I found in the dictionary file. This got me wondering about additional special characters (apostrophes for instance) that might need to be supported. Additionally, if the anagram API supported multiple languages it might need to include other characters (Ã±, umlaut?).
